# Local CSF Correction Pipeline for fMRI

This pipeline performs local cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) artifact correction to improve subcortical fMRI signal quality. It includes steps for ROI preprocessing, CSF extraction, and nuisance regression â€” tailored for high-resolution (7T) fMRI data.

--- 
## Purpose
Subcortical regions are especially prone to distortion due to low signal-to-noise ratio, small anatomical volume, and proximity to CSF [1, 2]. Standard CSF correction methods pool signals across anatomically distinct CSF compartments, which may failt to capture the spatial heterogeneity of CSF-related noise, risking residual noise or signal loss in anatomically specific regions.

## Input requirements
This pipeline works on processed fMRI data (fMRIprep) only.

To run this pipeline, you will need:

- Preprocessed BOLD images (NifTI)
    'sub-001_task-rest_run-01_bold_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_preproc.nii.gz'

- Confound files (TSV) 
    'sub-001_task-rest_run-01_bold_confounds.tsv'

- CSF probability tissue masks (NifTI)
    'sub-001_T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_class-CSF_probtissue.nii.gz'

- MNI template (NifTI)
    'mni_icbm152_t1_tal_nlin_asym_09c.nii.gz'

- ROI masks (e.g., Harvard-Oxford Atlas)


---
## Configuration 
Edit `config.py` to customize:
- SUBJECT_ID: Subject ID read from environment variable (SUBJ)
- BASE_DIR, DATA_DIR, ROI_DIR, OUTPUT_DIR: Directory paths
- TEMPLATE_PATH: MNI template used for ROI resampling
- DEFAULT_REST_RUNS *(optional)*: List of run labels (e.g., ['run-01', 'run-02']) â€” adjust if your data has a different format
- DEFAULT_ROIS: List of subcortical ROIs to include in the pipeline
- CONDITION *(optional)*: Name of scan condition (e.g., 'rest')
- DEFAULT_MOTION_CONFOUNDS: Motion regressors to include in the nuisance regression step

## Modules overview
This pipeline is performed executing a sequence of operations, each of which corresponds to a function in the helper files.

Helper files (inside /utils) include:
- `process_roi.py` for all ROI-related operations
- `extract_csf.py` for local CSF mask and time series extraction
- `func_timeseries.py` for functional signal denoising

There are 8 available operations:
**ROI Processing**
- `initialize_roi_dict` â€“ Creates a dictionary of available ROIs
- `process_roi_mask` â€“ Loads and resamples ROIs to MNI space
- `threshold_roi_mask` â€“ Binarizes probabilistic ROI masks
- `dilate_binary_roi_mask` â€“ Expands binary ROIs outward to define a local search region

**CSF Extraction**
- `extract_local_csf_mask` â€“ Identifies CSF voxels within the dilated mask but outside the gray matter ROI
- `extract_local_csf_time_series` â€“ Extracts average local CSF time series from the functional image
- `add_local_csf_time_series_to_confound_file` â€“ Appends local CSF regressors to fMRIPrep confounds

**Time Series Correction**
- `compute_functional_timeseries` â€“ Applies nuisance regression and returns cleaned functional signals


The Jupyter Notebook `example_pipeline_demo.ipynb` provides a step-by-step example of how to run the local CSF correction pipeline using sample inputs.
